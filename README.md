# PowerShell-Pentesting Project

PowerShell has become a powerful tool in the arsenal of penetration testers due to its extensive capabilities and deep integration with Windows operating systems. Leveraging its scripting language, pen testers can execute various tasks such as enumeration, exploitation, and post-exploitation activities. PowerShell's ability to interact with the systemâ€™s internals allows testers to gather detailed information about the network, extract credentials, and manipulate files and processes stealthily.
